# Angelist-application-hack
automate job application on Angelist.com

This script targets all companies in your search results with a custom note.

1. Search Angel List for your location and keywords.
2. Paste this script into the console and run it.
3. Wait while it works.
4. Copy the results from the console for your records.

Caution:You will probably need to run it several times, because it appears to get
interrupted by Angel List's interspersed 'call to action' buttons in the search
results. Fortunately, once you apply to a job, it hides from the results.

later: Updated the code to run recursively and pause for 4 secs in between pauses or stops
